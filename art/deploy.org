* Local build production

    The project was built assuming it is hosted at the server root.
    To override this, specify the homepage in your package.json.
    For example, add this to build it for GitHub Pages:

      "homepage": "http://myname.github.io/myapp",

    The build folder is ready to be deployed.
    You may also serve it locally with a static server:

      npm install -g pushstate-server
      pushstate-server build
      open http://localhost:9000
